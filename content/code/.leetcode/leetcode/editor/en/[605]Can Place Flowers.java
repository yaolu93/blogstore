/**
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are 
not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots. 

 Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty 
and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be 
planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false 
otherwise. 

 
 Example 1: 
 Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
 
 Example 2: 
 Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
 
 
 Constraints: 

 
 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10⁴ 
 flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1. 
 There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed. 
 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length
