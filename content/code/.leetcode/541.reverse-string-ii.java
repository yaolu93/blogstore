 * Testcase Example:  '"abcdefg"\n2'
 *
 * Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every
 * 2k characters counting from the start of the string.
 * 
 * If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are
 * less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the
 * first k characters and leave the other as original.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
 * Output: "bacdfeg"
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
 * Output: "bacd"
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
 * s consists of only lowercase English letters.
 * 1 <= k <= 10^4
