#
# Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the
# number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to
# threshold.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6
# respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the
# threshold).
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5.
# Note that averages are not integers.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
# 1 <= k <= arr.length
# 0 <= threshold <= 10^4
# 
#

class Solution:
    def numOfSubarrays(self, arr: List[int], k: int, threshold: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        sum_threshold = threshold*k
        
        n = len(arr)

        window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
        
        if window_sum >= sum_threshold:
            count += 1 

            
        for i in range(k, n):
            window_sum = window_sum + arr[i] - arr[i - k]
            if window_sum >= sum_threshold:
                count += 1
        return count
