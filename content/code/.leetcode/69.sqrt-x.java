 * Testcase Example:  '4'
 *
 * Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
 * 
 * Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and
 * only the integer part of the result is returned.
 * 
 * Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator,
 * such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 4
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 8
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part
 * is truncated, 2 is returned.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
